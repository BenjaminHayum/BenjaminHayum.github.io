### Get to know me

Hello, my name is Ben Hayum. As a PhD student in Computer Sciences at UW-Madison, I am driven by a sense of purpose to contribute to the responsible development of Artificial Intelligence.

My journey began with simple exposures and then realization: AI will fundamentally reshape our future and be the defining challenge of our lifetime. This insight sparked not just academic interest, but a deep commitment to helping shepherd this technology toward better outcomes beyond [the trajectories set by baseline forces](https://www.narrativeark.xyz/p/the-gods-of-straight-lines).

This lead me to found the [Wisconsin AI Safety Initiative](https://waisi.org/) (WAISI) which in 4 short semesters has now taught over 150 students about the harms/risks due to AI and the contours of the technical and policy proposals to mitigate them. We retain 50 students, including 13 PhDs, in our advanced groups who participate in weekly frontier paper readings groups. These students span the laboratories of 11 different professors on campus.

This lead me to my current work with [Professor Grigoris Chrysos](https://grigorisg9gr.github.io/_pages/about/) using methods from the Tensor Literature for Interpretability improvements. In undergraduate, I worked with [Professor Sharon Li](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sharonli/) exploring how Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback influences the probability distributions of positive and negative human-like behaviors. Before this, I worked with [Professor Matthew Banks](https://neuro.wisc.edu/staff/banks-matthew-i/), where I focused on neurometric analyses of patients under the influence of delirium. I am also really into meditation and mental performance.

I am always exicted to connect with new people and spar friendly ideas together. Feel free to reach out to me at [bhayum@wisc.edu](mailto:bhayum@wisc.edu) to discuss ML Safety, WAISI, The Future, Building Bridges across Communities, or anything in between.
