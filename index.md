### Get to know me

Hey all, Iâ€™m Ben Hayum, a PhD student in Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 

I was fortunate to be exposed to information early on that convinced me of just how massive the influence of AI was going to be on the future. Sitting with that realization made me see how it was personally impossible for me to not get involved and try to help work the trajectory for the better. 

This lead me to found the [Wisconsin AI Safety Initiative](https://waisi.org/) which in 3 short semesters has now taught over 100 students about the spectrum of benefits, harms and risks due to AI, as well as the many technical and policy proposals to solve them. We currently retain around 35-40 students who participate in weekly frontier paper readings groups and many of whom are actively engaged with research on campus, spanning the laboratories of 7 different professors.

This also lead me to my current work with [Professor Grigoris Chrysos](https://grigorisg9gr.github.io/_pages/about/) using methods from the Tensor Literature for Interpretability improvements. In undergraduate, I worked with [Professor Sharon Li](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sharonli/) exploring how Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback influences the probability distributions of human-like behaviors. Before this, I worked with [Professor Matthew Banks](https://neuro.wisc.edu/staff/banks-matthew-i/), where I focused on neurometric analyses of patients under the influence of delirium and psychedelics. It may then come as little surprise that I am also really into meditation, spirituality, and mental performance.

Feel free to reach out to me at [bhayum@wisc.edu](mailto:bhayum@wisc.edu) to discuss ML and interpretability research, getting involved with WAISI, the future, or anything in between!
