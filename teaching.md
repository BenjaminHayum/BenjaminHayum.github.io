## Teaching Assistant

CS 220: Data Science Programming I in Fall 2024. Over 1,000 students enrolled in course.

## Wisconsin AI Safety Initiative

#### Research Programs

Led design and execution of program to support student research skills growth via weekly drop in office hours with more experienced PhD students and collaborative co-working hours.

See our Handbook [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RXpxkFoX6PnItmJ083QVNK-PbBa106KRRlLh_g7Jyqk/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Advanced Programs

Led design and execution of infrastructure to host advanced weekly reading group in Technical AI Safety and Policy AI Safety. 

This program, Safety Scholars, currently host about 50 students, including 13 PhD students.

#### Introductory Programs

Led design of infrastructure and customized curriculums based on [BlueDot's 8 Week AI Safety Fundamentals Program](https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/) to educate students in Technical AI Safety and Policy AI Safety.

These programs have taught over 150 students at UW-Madison, with about 35 of them personally taught by myself.

## Rise-AI Initiative

Met with Leaders [UW-Madison's Rise-AI Initiative](https://rise.wisc.edu/rise-ai/) to discuss bolstering student involvement, hosting interdisciplinary events on AI, and university strategy. 

Held discussions with the [Center for Teaching, Learning & Mentoring](https://ctlm.wisc.edu/) on what aspects of future AI Literacy are most necessary to promote at the University and how we ought to do so.
